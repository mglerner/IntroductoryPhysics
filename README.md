# Decolonising Introductory Physics

**NOTE: based on feedback from potential other users, we are currently updating the code to work as a Wordpress plugin, rather than as a series of Python scripts. This work is taking longer than expected. I am still using the code in my own classes, so please feel encouraged to contact me directly if you'd like to use it before it's properly released.**

**TLDR for students:** Research a scientist who doesn't look like Isaac Newton, fill out the [form](https://mglerner.github.io/pages/nonnewtonian-scientists.html), email me the results <mglerner@protonmail.com>, and your scientist will appear in the textbook links below!

**TLDR for teachers:** Check out the textbook below. It's organized by
  chapter and section. Find a scientist relevant to your class. Click
  on the "Download Slide" link and get a powerpoint slide with the
  scientist's picture(s) and description (descriptions in the Notes
  section of the PPTX slide)!

People have written more eloquently than I can about this (e.g Chanda Prescod-Weinstein's 
[Decolonising Science Reading
List](https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f#.3yyou2as5)
and her followup articles including [Making Meaning of "Decolonising"](https://medium.com/@chanda/making-meaning-of-decolonising-35f1b5162509)). It
is certainly true, for instance, that  working through a common
syllabus with a standard textbook will have intro students looking at
a progression of Physicists all of whom look like Newton.

As a teacher, I thought "oh, I'll just grab someone else's annotated
syllabus so that I can consistently augment my own class with a more
inclusive (note: now I might say 'decolonised' .. but I'm not sure 
I'm quite sophisticated enough in my language) set of models." I
poked around the internet, but couldn't find such a syllabus. So, as
part of my intro class, one of the assignments is essentially "find an
example of a Physicist who doesn't look like Newton, write something
about that person, include a picture if you can, and figure out where
that person could have been included in our syllabus." The assignment
gets the full weight of any other weekly assignment. I'm putting this
on github (1) so that it can be a resource for others (ideally, you'd
be able to say "oh, I'm covering Knight Chapter 3, Section 2 today
... here's a quick PPT slide I can slip in with my clicker questions")
(2) so that people can send in
[PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to make
this better.

Some details:

In order to make contributions easy, information about each scientist
lives in a different file. It's a simple text file, and I've set up a
page that can make one for you
[here](https://mglerner.github.io/pages/nonnewtonian-scientists.html). Check
it out!

If you like, you can also make a file directly yourself. Here is an
[Example File](ExampleScientist.txt).

* Add as much of the information as you can, but please feel
  *encouraged* to send me incomplete files if that's what you have!
  Something is way better than nothing!

* Try to follow the format as well as you can (filling in the boxes on
  the
  [form](https://mglerner.github.io/pages/nonnewtonian-scientists.html)
  makes this really easy!). If you send me files
  (either via email <mglerner@proton.com> or as a PR), I'll gladly reformat them to fix any
  small mistakes, so don't let that stop you!

* Please cite your sources (Wikipedia is OK!), and feel free to quote
  explicitly, but don't plagiarize!

* Including links to pictures really helps!

I have used two versions of the assignment. First, when I'm trying to
generate new content:

>The content of this particular course (and this particular
textbook) has pretty much focused on ideas developed by white,
European men. In fact, working through a common syllabus with a
standard textbook will have you looking at a progression of
Physicists all of whom (to within rounding error) look like
Newton. I'd like to say that's a historical accident, but it's actually
more complicated than that, and perhaps not always so benign as the
word "accident" might imply.

>Your task in this assignment is to broaden this focus by writing a
paragraph or so about someone who's made a significant contribution
to Physics and who is not a white, European male. This can be a
contemporary or a historical figure. Try to find someone you don't
already know about - or perhaps someone you do know about but think
should be better known. Your paragraphs should include telling us
who the person is, the contribution(s), the significance of the
contribution(s), something about that person's life and how it
impacted that person's experience that led to his or her
discoveries. Next, looking through the table of contents and/or
index of your textbook, tell us where the person's contributions
might be placed in this textbook (the textbook covers a very large
amount of Physics, so you may be able to answer this part even if we
won't cover the relevant contributions this semester). Finally, if
at all possible, please include a link to a picture of the person.

>It would be great if everyone found a different scientist to
describe, so if you know whom someone else is choosing to write
about, please choose someone else.

>Our intention is to make the results of this assignment public, so
please submit your assignment in the format described by the example
file located at https://goo.gl/AkT97E and please note that it's really
easy to create your own file by using the
[form](https://mglerner.github.io/pages/nonnewtonian-scientists.html). Since
we plan to make this
public, please be sure either to include your name if you'd like
your name included in the text, or to leave it out if you don't want
it included. Please remember to cite your sources.


This year, I'm switching textbooks, and have a slightly different
assignment:

>The content of this particular course (and this particular
textbook) has pretty much focused on ideas developed by white,
European men. In fact, working through a common syllabus with a
standard textbook will have you looking at a progression of
Physicists all of whom (to within rounding error) look like
Newton. I'd like to say that's a historical accident, but it's actually
more complicated than that, and perhaps not always so benign as the
word "accident" might imply.

>Your first task in this assignment is to broaden this focus by writing a
paragraph or so about someone who's made a significant contribution to
Physics and who is not a white, European male, and to place that
paragraph in our current textbook. You can choose a contemporary or a
historical figure. Try to find someone you don't already know about -
or perhaps someone you do know about but think should be better
known. Your paragraphs should include telling us who the person is,
the contribution(s), the significance of the contribution(s),
something about that person's life and how it impacted that person's
experience that led to his or her discoveries. **NOTE:** as discussed
in class, the main focus this year is figuring out which scientists to
place into our current textbook (Matter and Interactions), and where
to place them. Thus, you're **strongly** encouraged to take
information either from the current collection of scientists on
github, or from David Rosengrant's collection of
[STEM Heroes](https://www.usfsp.edu/rosengrant-stem-lab/physics-and-stem-heroes/). Please
choose one of those, check it for plagiarism, and continue with the assignment.

> Next, looking through the table of contents and/or index of your
textbook, tell us where the person's contributions might be placed in
this textbook (the textbook covers a very large amount of Physics, so
you may be able to answer this part even if we won't cover the
relevant contributions this semester). Find an online picture of the
person, and record a link to that picture.

> Once you have all of that information, type it into the online
[form](https://mglerner.github.io/pages/nonnewtonian-scientists.html),
and enter the resulting information into the assignment on Moodle.

> TLDR: Choose one that's already done, check it for plagiarism, find at
  least one new image or fact, place it in the new textbook. For extra
  credit, do a second new scientist. Use MLA.

Her research is focused on development of nanotechnology and potential applications to bioanalytical chemistry ("Gang-yu Liu", 2017). To investigate the cancer cell signaling and allergy, she has used high resolution images taken by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) and published papers about her research on nanostructures of ligands and receptors.Through her research using AFM, the method for nanografting for determining the orientation and packing of biomolecules on surfaces has been developed significantly. Also, her research on nanotechnology and bioanalytical chemistry has been expected to have a potential for medical and biological applications ranging from medicines to fundamental studies of molecular biology. Based on her fabulous work on nanolithographic methods, she got several awards including Career Development Chair Award, Wayne State University (2000-2001), Outstanding Scholarly Achievement Award, Wayne State University (2000), NSF CAREER Award (1997-2001), Arnold and Mabel Beckman Young Investigator Award (1996-1998), and Camille and Henry Dreyfus New Faculty Award (1994-1999).</td>

      <td>Amalie Emmy Noether was a German mathematician and physicist known for her landmark contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. One of her most remarkable discoveries in physics was Noether's theorem. The theorem states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. In 1915, Noether was helping two other scientists, David Hilbert and Felix Klein, to understand Albert Einstein's general relativity theory when she proved Noether's first theorem. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert: "Yesterday I received from Miss Noether a very interesting paper... I'm impressed that such things can be understood in such a general way. The old guard at Göttingen should take some lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff." Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics because of the insight it gives into conservation laws and also being practical calculation tool. For example, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.</td>

      <td>Ibn al-Haytham (c.965 - c.1040 AD), aka Alhazen, was a physicist as well as a mathematician and astronomer during the Islamic Golden Age. Alhazen is most known for his contributions to optics and the scientific method. Going against the emission theory of Euclid and Ptolemy and the intromission theory of Aristotle, Ibn al-Haytham theorized that we see objects because the eyes receive the rays of light that reflect off an object (Wikipedia). His most famous work, Kitāb al-manāẓir, described this phenomenon and included details about reflection and refraction. Ibn al-Haytham was keen on using experimentation and mathematical reasoning to support his theories (Lorch). Alhazen also had an understanding that to prove a hypothesis, one must perform experiments of have numerical evidence. Through this practice, he showed an understanding of the scientific method many centuries before it was established. In addition to sight and the scientific method, Alhazen investigated the rainbow, moonlight, celestial physics, motion of the body, and more (Wikipedia).</td>

      <td>Bhāskara II</td>
      <td>Bhāskara II was a 12th century Indian mathematician and astronomer. Among his many notable accomplishments, which include using differentials centuries before Newton “invented” calculus (Bhāskara II), Bhāskara II was one of the first to design a perpetual motion machine. The “Bhāskara wheel” has curved spokes filled with mercury, which flows downward in the direction of rotation, theoretically creating a shifting force to power perpetual rotation (Simanek 2010). Unfortunately, Bhāskara II didn’t account for the unbalancing effect of the mercury flow, which shifts the wheel’s center of mass and eventually disrupts rotation (Simanek). Bhāskara II’s design has remained a fascination for physicists and countless researchers have tried to optimize his design and create a truly perpetually rotating wheel.  All have failed (Simanek). Bhāskara II was instrumental is the development of Indian mathematics, and was honored in 1981 with an eponymous satellite (Bhāskara II).</td>

He and Tsung-dao Lee received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on parity non conservation of weak interaction. The two proved theoretically that one of the basic quantum-mechanics laws, the conservation of parity, is violated in the so-called weak nuclear reactions, those nuclear processes that result in the emission of beta or alpha particles. They had examined all experiments in the past and found that none of them proved parity conservation of weak interaction. Based on this, they came up with several ways to examine that parity non conservation of weak interaction and this theory has proved later on.</td>

      <td>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was the first Indian Physicist to win the Novel prize for his work in light scattering. He was born on November 7th, 1988 in Tamil Nadu. His father was a professor of physics and mathematics and his mother came from a family of scholars. In 1921, when he was returning to India from London, on the voyage, he became fascinated with the blue color of Mediterranean sea. He had some physics apparatus on him - a prism, a miniature spectroscope and a diffraction grating - which he used to prove that the sea was scattering sunlight by water molecule, which refutes Lord Rayleigh's explanation that the color of the sea is a reflection of the color of the sky. But Rayleigh argued that the blue color of the sky was caused by scattering of sunlight by the air molecules. From Raman's discovery, he was obsessed with the idea of light scattering. Analyzing the effect of scattering light by water was not easy, so Raman made visual observations of how scattered lights of different color passed through liquid. This visual observation is now called the Raman scattering and is the result of the Raman effect - the change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. Raman effect was an important discovery because after its discovery, physicists used this technique to study the vibration and rotation of molecules. By the late 1930s, the Raman effect was a principal method of chemical analysis because Raman spectroscopy could be easily used to solid, liquid, gas and aqueous solutions.</td>

He has made major contributions in the areas of materials characterization using x-ray diffraction and small angle x-ray scattering, and their use as a tool in studying heat-activated processes in materials. He developed methods of quantitative x-ray diffractions of compounds; e.g., Ca(OH)2 in hydrous silicates. Robert Bragg originated the now-standard practice of using the data as self-calibrating in the quantitative determination of preferred orientation in polycrystalline aggregates. His work provides clear guidance in the analysis of the diffraction patterns of materials of high transparency to x-rays, e.g. Be, B, and C. His novel studies of the coarsening of the microstructure of glassy carbon using small angle x-ray scattering have provided the accepted value for the activation energy for a-direction vacancy migration in graphite.His most important work is the recent demonstration that all apparently unordered carbon materials are mixtures of metastable carbon compounds, and his first principles derivation of the equations governing the phase transformations at high temperatures as these materials are converted to graphite.</td>

      <td>Warren Henry</td>
      <td>Warren Henry was an African American Physicist that had somewhat of an astute background for a black man of his time. Both of his parents had graduated from the Tuskegee Institute, and George Washington Carver lived and conducted research on his parent’s farm during the summer months (Williams). It can be quite apparent to see where his interest in the sciences more than likely came from during his childhood. He later attended Tuskegee where he majored in Mathematics, English, and French (Williams). Later wanting to conduct research, he turned to Rutgers University where they then turned him away (Williams).  As a result, he ended up going to the Naval Research Laboratory where he would reside for the next 12 years (Williams). During that time he was able to research and gain the knowledge of materials that were at a rather low temperature (Williams). His expertise regarding low-temperature research was probably unsurpassed in the U.S. while at the Naval Research Laboratory. He was also the head of several projects at several institutions like UC Berkeley amongst others. Even though his research in low temperatures was quite significant, he was most known for his work in magnetism and superconductivity. His work in this field was what brought him the most praise by the scientific community. He had written a highly detailed study that consisted of a "demonstration of the proof of non-interacting paramagnetic ions and how they’re a significant contribution” when considering magnetism and superconductivity (Williams). His work was a significant contribution to the world because his models and ideas have been implemented into modern textbooks, and are still widely used to this day. A prime example of that being the demonstration I had spoken of earlier that took place back in 1934. [Commentary from a second student:] Warren Henry (1909 – 2001) was an African American physicist who specialized in the fields of magnetism and superconductivity (Williams 2008). His contributions to the world of physics include hundreds of published articles regarding his research, the partial discovery of paramagnetism and how it works on a quantum level, and a “demonstration of the proof of non-interacting paramagnetic ions” (Williams 2008). His research was important for the U.S. naval forces during the time of the Vietnam War, as U.S. submarines were able to be equipped with better technology and sonar. He received his undergraduate degree in mathematics, English, and French from Tuskegee Institute, and he received his PhD in physical chemistry in 1941 from University of Chicago (“Warren Elliot Henry”). His background also includes an education involving many Nobel Prize winning scientists; “Arthur Compton taught him quantum mechanics, Wolfgang Pauli taught nuclear forces, Robert Millikan taught molecular spectra” (Williams 2008). Henry was a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Science Foundation, and is recognized as one of the best, most important African American physicists of all time (“Warren Elliot Henry”).</td>

Ruby worked briefly as a teacher before receiving a job in the radiophysics division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization where she worked on radar technology for the army. Her most notable contribution, however, lay in her interest in extraterrestrial radio signals. She demonstrated, with the help of two colleagues, that radio brightness across the sky could be treated as a two-dimensional sum of an infinite series of simple waveforms and showed that it could be computed using the Fourier transform. Ruby's work served as a mathematical foundation for radio astronomy. In addition to being a brilliant scientist, she was an avid supporter of women's rights believing in equal employment and pay for women.</td>

Countless are the cases, of female scientists that have to choose between having a family and their professional careers, and smaller is the number of women of color that have a leadership position in the labs where they do research. For this reason, it is important to shed the light on inspiring women who are making major contributions to their fields because they are role models that future scientists can look up to. I found a scientist who is making groundbreaking discoveries in the field of lasers. Her name is Hadiyah Green and she is developing laser technologies to kill cancer cells.

      <td>Chien-Shiung Wu</td>
      <td>Chien-Shiung Wu (1912-1997) was a Chinese-American experimental physicist who made significant contributions in the field of nuclear physics1 (Wikipedia). Wu worked on the infamous Manhattan Project where she developed the process of separating uranium metal to uranium-235 and uranium-238 by gaseous diffusion1 (Wikipedia). Her work was credited to contradict the hypothetical Law of Conservation of Parity, which at the time was a well-established law and basically entailed a very complicated way of proving the idea of symmetry, where particles that are mirror images of each other will act in identical ways3 (ListVerse). Her experiments were incredibly significant in that she was able to show that one particle was more likely to eject an electron than the other and they were therefore not symmetrical and that observation overturned a 30-year belief and shattered the conservation of parity law3 (ListVerse). The discovery of parity violation was a major contribution to particle physics and the development of the Standard Model which is a paradigm of the modern quantum field theory2 (Wikipedia). It is little wonder that Wu is now hailed as “The First Lady of Physics” and the “Chinese Marie Curie”1(Wikipedia). However, unfortunately, like many of her contemporary female scientists, Wu’s work was discredited and her male co-workers Lee and Yang got awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for ‘her’ experiment3 (ListVerse). In fact, she received no mention or credit for her significant contribution to the project until 1978, when she was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize for Physics two decades after her ground-breaking experiment1(Wikipedia). [Commentary from a second student:] Wu was born in 1912. She got her B.E. from the National Central University of Nanking, China. She then got her Ph.D from University of California, Berkeley. Wu disproved the law of conservation of parity. She found that parity was not conserved in nuclear beta decay. She has many other achievements, such as working on the Manhattan Project and helped in the development of a more sensitive Geiger counter.</td>

Otto Hahn and Meitner led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron; the results were published in early 1939. Meitner and Otto Frisch understood that the fission process, which splits the atomic nucleus of uranium into two smaller nuclei, must be accompanied by an enormous release of energy. This process is the basis of the nuclear weapons that were developed in the U.S. during World War II and used against Japan in 1945. Nuclear fission is also the process exploited by nuclear reactors to generate electricity.</td>

      <td>E. C. George Sudarshan is a theoretical physicist born in Pallam, Kerala. He has made significant contributions such as proposing the theory of V-A WeakForce which is central to radioactive decay and nuclear fission. Controversially, he was not awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on quantum optics (Sudharshan-Glauber representation), while Glauber received recognition for it in 2005.</td>

      <td>Chen-Ning Yang</td>
      <td>Chen-Ning Frank Yang, also known as Yang Zhenning, was born October 1, 1922. He is a Chinese physicist who works on statistical mechanics and particle physics. He and Tsung-dao Lee received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on parity non conservation of weak interaction. The two proved theoretically that one of the basic quantum-mechanics laws, the conservation of parity, is violated in the so-called weak nuclear reactions, those nuclear processes that result in the emission of beta or alpha particles. They had examined all experiments in the past and found that none of them proved parity conservation of weak interaction. Based on this, they came up with several ways to examine that parity non conservation of weak interaction and this theory has proved later on.</td>

And here are some scientists descriptions my students wrote up. Feel
free to add them!

# Scientists

## En'hedu'anna

Somebody needs to include her! The first scientist we have a record of
a is a Sumerian woman astronomer! Here are
[some](http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com/2013/05/enheduanna-our-first-great-scientist.html)
[pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enheduanna) to start!

## Zhang Heng

Zhang Heng, astronomer, mathematician, inventor and poet in China’s
Han Dynasty (78-139 C.E.).  Invented the world’s first seismometer
(for detecting earthquakes), improved the water clock, and developed a
water-powered instrument to help measure the positions of stars and
planets.

## Henrietta Swan Leavitt

Henrietta Swan Leavitt, whose job was documenting the characteristics
of "Cephid variable" stars in the early 1900’s, before computers were
available to do such work.  These stars have a brightness that varies
with a stable period, and Henrietta’s job was to look at photographic
plates that contained images such variable stars. In the process of
examining over 1700 images of stars in a nearby galaxy, she discovered
an important regularity between the brightness of such stars and the
period of the variation of the star.  That discovery let scientists
determine the distance to other galaxies, which helped lead to the
discovery that the universe is expanding.

## Whisoh Lee

Whisoh Lee, a Korean theoretical physicist worked on fundamental
particle physics, and whose work influenced Abdus Salam’s work on
electro-weak theory as well as the developing the basis for the Higg’s
mechanism.

## Abdus Salam

Abdus Salam– Pakistani theoretical physicist, earned the Nobel Prize
in 1979 for his work unifying electromagnetism with the weak
interaction (responsible for "beta decay" of radioactive elements).

## Ibn Sahl

Snell's law was "first discovered in the 10th century by the Persian scientist Ibn Sahl, not centuries later by Snell" [Scientists Must Challenge What Makes Studies Scientific](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/macroscope/scientists-must-challenge-what-makes-studies-scientific)

## Al Hazen Ibn al-Haytham

Invented pinhole camera [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham)

# Notes to me/developers

The python script here autogenerates annotated tables of contents. I usually 
run it via the Jupyter notebook, Annotating.ipynb.

Also worth noting: when I assign this in class as a Moodle assignment, Moodle tends to turn markdown into HTML. To get the markdown back, I use [html2text](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/) (originally written by Aaron Swartz). I do this on the command line, in zsh:

```bash
for f in *.html; do html2text < $f > ${f:r}.md; done
```

TODO
* Make everyone go through the form
* Add more textbooks
  * Specifically, since I'm switching to Matter and Interactions, add that.
  * This will likely require fixing all of the stuff that isn't really factored in terms of where textbooks, powerpoint slides, etc. actually live.
* Consider restructuring to make adding more textbooks easier.
  * Maybe the work of adding a textbook comes on the professor side (or, at least, is less frequent).
  * Adding the textbook gives a mapping between topics and chapters.
  * Filling out The Form has students select a chapter and then a list of topics.
  * That topic selection can be mapped, behind the scenes, to the map of a new textbook.
  * Maaaaayyyybeeee I should consider a real database?!
* Focus on 2nd semester
* Fix mixup between calc-based and algebra-based
   * Here, note for example that Sylvester James Gate is listed in 2nd
     edition, but is showing up in 3rd
   * Also note that I may have turned some 2nd edition ones into 3rd
     by accident, so just check the TOC.
