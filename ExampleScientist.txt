# Description
Margaret Murnane is an optical physicist at the University of
Colorado. She has built "the fastest things that humans have ever
created" lasers which can flash for "ten quadrillionths of a second"!
Her background includes the fact that "physics was [her] worst subject
in high school" but she dreamed of being a physicist because she loved
the "excitement of discovery." She and her husband now run a lab at
the University of Colorado. In the lab, she records "some of the
fastest motions in our natural world." Her lasers can capture the
movement of electrons. Her newest laser and x-ray beams can flash for
less than 0.00000000000000001 seconds. Talk about "in the blink of an
eye!" She is able to pass on excitement and knowledge to
students. Scientists use her lasers which are based on her
titanium-sapphire design to study a wide range of phenomena (chemical
reactions, etc.).
